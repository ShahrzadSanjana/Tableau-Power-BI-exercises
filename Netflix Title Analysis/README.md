**Overview**

I wanted to demonstrate and practice my dashboarding skills and ability to present visualizations on metrics that I think will matter most to a business in a clean, thoughtful, and easily digestible manner.

But rather than stopping at only building a dashboard, I wanted to put myself in the shoes of an Analyst at Netflix and provide a few recommendations/actions, based on my review of the Tableau dashboard, to a fictitious senior executive to consider in spurring business performance – thereby allowing me to also demonstrate business acumen and nous by leveraging my economics/business background.

To this end, I downloaded this dataset of Netflix Titles in CSV format from Kaggle, and cleaned it using the Data Cleaning techniques described below, and then created my visualizations and dashboard with KPI’s.
