**#Overview#**

I wanted to demonstrate and practice my dashboarding skills and ability to present visualizations on metrics that I think will matter most to a business in a clean, thoughtful, and easily digestible manner.

But rather than stopping at only building a dashboard, I wanted to put myself in the shoes of an Analyst at Netflix and provide a few recommendations/actions, based on my review of the Tableau dashboard, to a fictitious senior executive to consider in spurring business performance â€“ thereby allowing me to also demonstrate business acumen and nous by leveraging my economics/business background.
